# How to use
WIP

Keyword method works out of box, it's just regex.

Zero Shot Classifier should also work out of the box.

To use Cosine Similarity:
1. You need to download GloVe 6B file.
2. Put the GloVe together with the glovetojson.py file in the same folder, run the python file
3. Put the generated file into the base directory of this project

# License
You can use this software however you like as long as:
1. you keep or include the original unmodified LICENSE file in this or any subsequent work that is based on this code,
2. you do not use works based on this code for commercial purposes.

Check out the license file for the formal version. Just don't use this code to charge money from people, otherwise I don't care what you do with it. And attributing to me would be appreciated, of course :)
